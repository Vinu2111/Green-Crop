Description
This project is developed using Java Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL as the database, and Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). The system includes role-based access control (RBAC) with roles such as ADMINISTRATIVE, MANAGER, and SCIENTIST. It uses JWT-based authentication for secure login and token refresh mechanisms. AJAX (or Fetch API) is employed for dynamic, asynchronous communication between the client and server. Hibernate JPQL is used to facilitate efficient database operations. Proper logging is implemented to ensure maintainability and traceability, adhering to industry best practices.

Tech Stack
Java-Spring Boot - A modern and lightweight framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
Hibernate - An ORM framework for simplifying database operations by mapping Java objects to database tables.
MySQL - A reliable relational database management system for data storage.
AJAX/Fetch API - For dynamic updates to web pages without full-page reloads.
JWT - JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and authorization.
Features
Spring Boot Backend - Simplifies configuration and development of the backend system.
Role-Based Access Control - Secure access management for different user roles (ADMINISTRATIVE, MANAGER, SCIENTIST).
JWT Authentication - Secure sign-in, sign-up, and token refresh functionalities.
Hibernate ORM - Streamlined database operations with JPQL for efficient query handling.
AJAX/Fetch API - Enables dynamic content loading for a seamless user experience.
Comprehensive Logging - Provides detailed logging for debugging, monitoring, and maintenance.
Setup & Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash git clone https://github.com/KusalDemo/green-shadow-backend.git

2. Configure the Database
Step 1: Set up your MySQL database.

Create a database for the system. For example sql - CREATE DATABASE greenShadowDB;
Step 2: Update the database connection details in the application.properties file properties

MySQL Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/greenShadowDB?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
Hibernate Configuration
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.generate_statistics=true
Step 3: Run the application to auto-generate tables.

If you are using Hibernate with the spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update setting, the necessary database schema (tables, constraints) will be generated automatically when the application starts for the first time.
With this version, all the necessary code snippets and SQL commands are included for database configuration, making the steps clearer and more actionable.

Logging Configuration
text The system uses a robust logging strategy with appropriate levels:

INFO - For general application flow and milestones.
DEBUG - For detailed debugging and tracking variable states.
ERROR - For error events that may affect the system's stability.
WARN - For potentially harmful situations or system anomalies.
